# C-compiler-using-lex-and-yacc
Lex is not a complete language, but rather a generator representing a new language feature which can be added to different programming languages, called ``host languages.'' Just as general purpose languages can produce code to run on different computer hardware, Lex can write code in different host languages. The host language is used for the output code generated by Lex and also for the program fragments added by the user. We have designed a basic C language lexical analyzer using Flex.In this project, a program is given a code, if that program follows the lexical rules, it must print the tokens of that program in the output, otherwise, it must print the appropriate error.
